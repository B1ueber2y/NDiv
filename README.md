Created by [Shaohui Liu](https://github.com/B1ueber2y), [Xiao Zhang](https://github.com/xiao7199), [Jianqiao Wangni](https://sites.google.com/view/jianqiaown/), and [Jianbo Shi](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/). This repo includes the source code implementation for ["Normalized Diversification"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03608) in both PyTorch and TensorFlow. 

## Introduction
The Normalized Diversification loss, computed over normalized pairwise distance matrices of both the latent vectors and the corresponding outputs in a batchwise manner, was first described in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03608) to ameliorate the mode collapse problem. We release code on synthetic examples and image generation in this repo. Please follow the instructions in each folder.
